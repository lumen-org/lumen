# Summary

**introduction: say what it does: accessibilty to humans for probabilistic models.**
Machine Learning is a broad field with a plethora of different types of models available.
Lumen aims to make a specific, yet broad class of models, namely probabilistic models, more easily accessible to human analysts. 

**add one or two more sentences about what it provides**
It does so by providing an interactive web application for the visual exploration, comparison and validation of probabilistic models together with its data. 
As the main feature of the web-application a user can rapidly and incrementally build flexible and potentially complex visualizations of both the probabilistic machine learning model and the data that the model is trained on. 

**what is a probabilistic model? explain by comparison to classic ML**
Many classic machine learning methods predict the value of some target variable(s) given the value of some input variable(s).
Probabilistic models go beyond this 'point estimation' by instead of a particular value predicting a probability distribution over the target variable(s).
This allows, for instance, to also provide an estimation of the uncertainty of a prediction. 

While many classic Machine Learning methods can only predict a particular value of the target variable(s), probabilistic models instead capture the distribution of values of the target variables. 
This allows, for instance, to also provide an estimation of the prediction's uncertainty, a quanitity that is very relevant.

**make an example**
Imagine a model predicted that some image of suspicious skin does _not_ show a malignant tumor, it is extremely value to aditionally know whether the model is sure to 99.99% or just 51%.

**accessibility as key challenge**
A major challenge for both the development and application of Machine Learning methods is their accessibility to a human analyst, that is, the amount of hurdles that one has to take in order to practically make use and get a benefit of some method.
Lumen aims to improve accessibility for probabilistic machine learning models with respect to multiple aspects as follows:

(1) Education: By providing visual and intuitive representations of models Lumen may fosters understanding of the underlying modelling techniques. For instance

(2) Usage: 

(3) Debugging: Spotting artifacs

**Architecture**

While Lumen takes care of all user facing aspects (such as visualizations and interactions) all computational aspects  (any model or data queries that are triggered by a user-defined visualization) are delegated to a dedicated, python3/flask-based backend.
This backend is implemented in the `modelbase` project (TODO Link).
Here we follow a classic client-server architecture where Lumen is web-client and modelbase the web-service backend. For the standard usage scenario you would install both client and server locally on the same machine, however, they can of course be separated and hosted/run on different machines.

User interactions are translated into declarative query langauge for visualizations, which is then turned into SQL queries for data and alike statement for model queries.

**Supported classes of probabilistic models**

Lumen is model-agnostic in the sense that it can be used with models of any class of probabilistic models as long as this model class implements a common abstract API *in the modelbase backend*. 
In mathematical terms it essentially boils down to the following conditions that the supported model class

 * contains only quantitative and/or categorical random variables, i.e. there is no native support for images, time series or vector values variables, 
 * supports marginalization of random variables, i.e. the removal of any subset of a random variables of the model, 
 * supports conditioning of random variables on values of its domain, i.e. , and
 * supports density queries.

In fact Lumen makes no use of any specifity of a particular class of models, and we regard this genericity as one of its major features. Among the model classes that we have used Lumen with are Sum-Product-Networks, Condional-Gaussian Distributions, Probabilistic Progams based on PyMC3 and Kernel-Density-Estimators.

**Interface**

Lumen's  web-interface is inspired by the Polaris project and its commercial successor Tableau.
Note, however, that Lumen work for probabilistic models _and_ data, whereas Tableau is for the analysis of data only.
Figure \autoref{fig:LumenUI} shows an example screenshot of Lumen.
The Schema (left) contains the random variables of a probabilistic model. Users can drag'n'drop variables onto the visual channels of the Specification (middle).
Doing so will reconfigure the currently active visualization, that is, it will trigger the fetching of respective data and model queries from the modelbase backend and finally update and rerender the visualization.
To foster comparison of multiple models (for instance stemming from different classes of models, or from iterates of an incremental model building process) Lumen allows user to create as many visualizations of as many different models as they like.
Visualization are interactive themselves, and also resizable and freely movable on the plotting canvas.
