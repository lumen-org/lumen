`lumen` is an interactive web-application for the visualization of probabilistic machine learning models. 
Its main feature is the ability to rapidly and incrementally build flexible and potentially complex visualizations of both machine learning models and the data these models are trained on.

### Augmenting the process of building and exploring Probabilistic Models:

`lumen` aims to make a particular class of machine learning/statistical models, namely *probabilistic* models,  more easily accessible to humans. 
Such models model a set of target variables by means of a probability density function.
That is, different to many classic ML methods which predict a particular value of the target variable(s), probabilistic models instead capture the distribution of values of the target variables. 
Note, that all model training and model querying is delegated to the [modelbase backend](https://github.com/lumen-org/modelbase).

Building machine learning models is an inherently incremental task. 
You start out with a simple model, check whether it seems right so far, and then make your model incremently more complex until it solves your modelling goal sufficiently well. 
`lumen` lets you 'see' your model, understand how it performs, where it 'fails', and compare this to previous or alternative models. 

In particular it lets you:

 * plot any marginals of your models. 
Here, marginal means not just 1d but also higher dimensional marginals.
This lets you understand your model by studying 'slices' of it. 
We believe it helps you to fix model degrading artifacts that may indicate a problem in your model specification, model paramterization or possibly a bug in the machine learning algorithm of your model.
 * plot the model marginals together with data marginals. 
This lets you directly check the models fit to data.
 * plot predictions of your model along side corresponding data aggregations. 
This lets you understand its predictive behaviour, and also compare it observed quantities.
 * combine any of the above 'layers' into a single visualization.
 * change visualizations by flexibly assigning variables/data attributes to visual channels.
 * create as many of these visualizations side by side on an virtually infinite canvas. 
This lets you compare various stages of a model, compare different modelling approaches, and get a better overall understanding by combining many different visualizations of the same model.
 
### Using Lumen for data exploration only

You don't do any Machine Learning but simply would like to conveniently browse and explore data? 
`lumen` is the right place for you too!
It can be used to easily browse, explore, and compare *tabluar* data.
This is not what `lumen` was built for originally, but regard it as your 'free lunch' ;)

## Setup, Configuration and Running 

This explains how to get and configure `lumen` and its dependencies.

### Requirements

* `lumen` is a web application that requires access to a webservice instance of the Python3-based `modelbase` backend.
`lumen` allows a user to interactively compile data/model queries and visualize the queries results. `modelbase` does the computation and actually answers the queries. 
You can get `modelbase` [here](https://github.com/lumen-org/modelbase) where you also find information on how to set it up and run it as a webservice.

* `lumen` and `modelbase` need to be configured correctly with 'matching' settings. By default (both run locally on the same physical machie) this is the case and you do not need to change these settings:
  * hostname set in the configuration of `lumen` must match the actual hostname of `modelbase`.
  * port must match
  * protocol must match (http or https)

* `lumen` allows you to explore the models and data that are hosted by the `modelbase` backend. 
You can use the `modelbase` Python package to (1) train/create models from data, and then (2) host them by an instance of the `modelbase` webservice.
See the [documentation and introductory jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/lumen-org/modelbase) for more information. 
Also, a number of example models are created during the setup process of `modelbase` for your convenience.

### Setup

1. Clone/download this repository into a folder `<path>` of your choice.
2. Save these contents in a new text file with name `run.conf.js` at directory `<path>/js/`:

       define([], function () {

          // the model to be loaded on startup of the page
          /* this name must match the name of the model that the backend loaded */
          const DEFAULT_MODEL = '';

          // the model server to use for PQL queries
          /* Make sure that all aspects are correct:

               <protocol>://<ip/hostname>:<port>/<directory>

               * hostname/ip: e.g. 127.0.0.1
               * protocol: https or http ?
               * port: e.g. 8080
               * directory on host (if any)
           */  
          const DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS = 'http://127.0.0.1:52104';

          return {
            DEFAULT_MODEL,
            DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS
          }
       });

### Updating it

Just pull/download the lasted branch/version you'd like.

### Running it

1. make sure the `modelbase` backend is running and hosting the models that you'd like to explore. 
2. it's dead simple: Open `<path>/index.html` in your browser. 

Notes:
 * Using *chrome/chromium* as a browser is recommended, since it provides the best performance from our experience.

## Development Setup

This is only for you, if you want to contribute to the project.

1. Do the steps as described in the Setup section above.
2. Install [node-js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). For questions refer to the [getting started guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).
3. Update npm (part of node-js): `sudo npm install -g npm`
4. Install all npm-dependencies as provided by the projects `package.json`:
    * run from `<path>`: `npm install`

### Trouble Shooting

#### When open `lumen` in my browser I get the error message: "Could not load remote model from server!"
 
 1. Confirm that the backend server actually running
 2. Check the developer console log of the browser where you are loading the front-end. If it shows something like:
 
     ```Failed to load http://127.0.0.1:5000/webservice: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'null' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.```
 
 Then your probably run into some CORS issue because you serve the file directly from the file system, instead from a webserver running locally. See here for the issues:
   * [problem description: answer 1, point 2 ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3595515/xmlhttprequest-error-origin-null-is-not-allowed-by-access-control-allow-origin)
 
 Solutions:
   * serve it from a local webservice (preferred)
   * [disable CORS control in chrome](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome) (kind of hacky)
 

#### I get the error message: "Could not load remote model 'XXXX' from server 'XXXX' !"
  1. Confirm that the backend server is actually running
  2. Did the backend server load the particular model that you are trying to retrieve? Loaded models are listed in the terminal output of the backend server on its start up.
