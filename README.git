Development Setup
  - install WebStorm from IntelliJ
  - install node-js
  - update npm: '''sudo npm install -g npm'''
  - run '''npm install''' from project directory. this will resolve all development dependencies using the information from package.json   

Now for the ugly part  
  - download foundation 5.x, extract to correct path
  - download foundation icons, extract to correct path
  - download js-logger
